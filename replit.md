Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React with TypeScript for component-based UI development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching
- shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom plant-themed design tokens

**Design Patterns:**
- Component composition with reusable UI primitives (cards, forms, buttons, etc.)
- Custom hooks for mobile detection and toast notifications
- Form validation using react-hook-form with Zod schema validation
- Query-based data fetching with centralized API request handling
- Path aliases for clean imports (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- ESM module system throughout the application
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions with PostgreSQL dialect
- Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL

**API Design:**
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- JSON request/response format
- Request logging middleware for API calls
- Zod schema validation for request payloads
- In-memory storage implementation with interface-based design for easy database migration

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/plants` - Retrieve all plants
- `GET /api/plants/search?q=` - Search plants by name
- `GET /api/plants/:id` - Get specific plant details
- `GET /api/plants/slug/:slug` - Get plant by SEO-friendly slug (e.g., "monstera-deliciosa")
- `POST /api/propagation-requests` - Create propagation request
- `GET /api/propagation-requests/:id` - Retrieve propagation request

**Key Pages:**
- `/` - Homepage with plant search, popular plants, and zone selector in header
- `/all-plants` - Complete plant list with sorting (6 options) and difficulty filtering, simplified display
- `/guide/:plantSlug` - SEO-friendly plant propagation guide pages (e.g., /guide/monstera-deliciosa, /guide/snake-plant)

### Data Storage

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Drizzle):**
- **plants table**: Core plant data including name (display name), scientific/common names, difficulty levels, success rates, propagation methods, seasonal timing, zone recommendations, step-by-step instructions, and care guidelines. The `name` field serves as the primary display name, with `common_name` and `scientific_name` shown as secondary information.
- **propagation_requests table**: User propagation requests with plant references, zone information, maturity levels, and environment types (simplified to 3 essential fields)
- **users table**: User authentication data (username, password)

**Current Implementation:**
- **Supabase-Only Storage**: All plant data exclusively sourced from Supabase PostgreSQL database via DATABASE_URL
- No hardcoded plant fallbacks - returns empty arrays when database unavailable
- Interface-based storage abstraction (IStorage) for flexibility
- Uses node-postgres (pg) adapter with SSL for Supabase pooler compatibility
- **ID System**: Plant IDs use database primary key (bigint) converted to string for guaranteed uniqueness and consistency
- Database contains 30+ curated plants with full propagation details
- **Robust search**: searchPlants() includes fallback logic for databases with or without the `name` column - attempts query with `name` field first, falls back to `common_name` and `scientific_name` only if name column doesn't exist (error code 42703)
- **Connection safety**: All database operations (getAllPlants, getPlantById, searchPlants) use finally blocks to ensure pool cleanup, preventing connection leaks on both success and error paths

**Data Models:**
- JSON fields for complex data (propagation methods, monthly arrays, zone-specific recommendations, step-by-step instructions)
- Zod schemas generated from Drizzle tables for runtime validation
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces derived from database schema

### External Dependencies

**UI Component Library:**
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- shadcn/ui configuration for component styling and theming
- Nature-focused color scheme with deep forest greens (hsl(95, 60%, 25%)), cream backgrounds (hsl(40, 35%, 96%)), and organic rounded elements (0.75rem radius)
- Light theme emphasizes natural aesthetics with soft shadows and smooth transitions

**Development Tools:**
- Replit-specific plugins for development (cartographer, dev banner, runtime error overlay)
- TypeScript for type safety across client and server
- esbuild for production server bundling

**Database & ORM:**
- Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for serverless PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations
- drizzle-kit for schema management and database push operations

**Form & Validation:**
- react-hook-form for form state management
- Zod for schema validation
- @hookform/resolvers for Zod integration with react-hook-form
- drizzle-zod for generating Zod schemas from Drizzle tables

**Utility Libraries:**
- date-fns for date manipulation
- class-variance-authority (cva) for component variant styling
- clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional class management
- embla-carousel-react for carousel functionality
- nanoid for unique ID generation

**State Management:**
- TanStack React Query for server state, caching, and synchronization
- Query client configured with custom fetch function and error handling
- Infinite stale time for development efficiency

### Smart Features

**Instant Propagation Results:**
- Simplified UX eliminates multi-step forms - select a plant, get instant results
- Zone selector integrated into page headers (homepage + All Plants)
- Default values used automatically: maturity="mature", environment="inside"
- No form required - clicking any plant goes directly to personalized results
- Users can focus on browsing plants without data entry friction

**Zone Selection & Auto-Detection:**
- Zone selector visible in header with MapPin icon on Home and All Plants pages
- **Results page zone switching**: On propagation guide pages, zone selector appears below the plant name (not in header) - creates new request with updated zone and reloads content with zone-specific recommendations
- Auto-detects user's USDA hardiness zone on first visit using IP geolocation
- Uses free APIs (no API keys required):
  - ipapi.co (HTTPS) for IP-based geolocation and ZIP code
  - phzmapi.org (HTTPS) for ZIP code to hardiness zone conversion
- Zone persisted in localStorage across sessions (home/all-plants pages)
- Retry logic for network resilience (500ms backoff, 1 retry per API)
- Supports all USDA zones 1a-13b
- User can manually change zone at any time via header selector
- Silent fallback when detection fails (user selects manually)

**Plant Display System:**
- Consistent display hierarchy across all views (cards, search results, All Plants page)
- Primary header: `name` field (main display name)
- Secondary line: `common_name` â€¢ `scientific_name` (italicized) on same line with bullet separator
- Clean, minimal layout showing essential information only
- PlantCard and All Plants page also show difficulty level and success rate

**Sorting & Filtering (All Plants Page):**
- **6 Sort Options**: Name (A-Z), Name (Z-A), Difficulty (Easy to Hard), Difficulty (Hard to Easy), Success Rate (High to Low), Success Rate (Low to High)
- **Default Sort**: Alphabetically by name (A-Z) for easy browsing
- **Difficulty Filter**: All Difficulties, Easy, Medium, Hard - with dynamic count display showing number of filtered plants
- Real-time UI updates when sort or filter changes
- Clean, user-friendly controls with labeled dropdowns and visual feedback

**Component Architecture:**
- PlantCard and PlantSearch accept onPlantSelect callbacks for unified plant selection
- Direct-to-results flow bypasses legacy form route
- Toast notifications provide feedback when zone is missing

**SEO-Friendly URLs:**
- Plant guide pages use descriptive slugs: `/guide/:plantSlug` (e.g., `/guide/monstera-deliciosa`, `/guide/snake-plant`)
- Slug generation utility (`getPlantSlug`, `slugify`) converts plant names to URL-friendly format:
  - Lowercase conversion
  - Spaces replaced with hyphens
  - Special characters removed (except hyphens)
- Backend endpoint `GET /api/plants/slug/:slug` fetches plants by slug
- Navigation from home page and all-plants page uses slugs for clean, indexable URLs
- Improves SEO by including plant names directly in URLs instead of numeric IDs

**Ad Monetization Status (October 2025):**
- **AdSense Compliance**: All ad placeholder components have been removed from the site
- Removed to fix Google AdSense policy violation: "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
- Site is now clean and ready for AdSense review
- AdPlaceholder component file still exists in codebase but is not imported or rendered anywhere
- Once AdSense is approved and real ad codes are provided, actual Google ad scripts can be added to pages
- **Next Steps**: Submit site for Google AdSense review, then integrate actual ad code once approved

**Logo Navigation:**
- Logo (Plant Propagation icon + name) is clickable from all pages to return to homepage
- Implemented consistently across Home, All Plants, Results, and Propagation Form pages
- Uses wouter Link component with href="/" and data-testid="link-home-logo"
- Hover effect (opacity-80) provides visual feedback for clickable state

**Image Display Status (October 2025):**
- Image display code has been uncommented and enabled
- All components (PlantCard, PlantSearch, propagation form) have image tags enabled with proper error handling
- Fallback green gradient with Sprout icon shows when images fail to load
- **Root Cause Identified**: Wikipedia image URLs in database are returning 404 errors (broken links)
  - Tested multiple image URLs - all returning HTTP 404
  - Wikipedia commons images have been moved or deleted
  - Image code is working correctly - fallback displays as designed when URLs are invalid
- **Solution Needed**: Database imageUrl values need to be updated with valid, working image URLs
