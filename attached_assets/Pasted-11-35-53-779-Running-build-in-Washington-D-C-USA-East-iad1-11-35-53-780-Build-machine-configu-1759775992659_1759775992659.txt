11:36:06.850 (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
11:36:06.850 - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
11:36:06.851 - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
11:36:06.851 - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
